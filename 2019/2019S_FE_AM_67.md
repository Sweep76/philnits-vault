In a growth matrix proposed by Ansoff, which of the following is a strategy for expanding a business with an existing product in an existing market?

**a) Diversification**

**b) Market development**

**c) Market penetration**

**d) Product development**
?
**c) Market penetration**

## **Explanation:**

The **Ansoff Matrix** outlines four main strategies for business growth based on whether a company is targeting new or existing markets with new or existing products.

**Market Penetration** refers to a growth strategy focused on increasing sales of existing products within an existing market. This can be achieved through various means such as competitive pricing, increased marketing efforts, or improving customer loyalty. The goal is to gain a larger share of the current market without changing the core product or target audience.

### Overview of Other Options

|                      | **Existing Market**        | **New Market**            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Existing Product** | ‚úÖ **Market Penetration**  | ‚û°Ô∏è **Market Development** |
| **New Product**      | ‚û°Ô∏è **Product Development** | üîÅ **Diversification**    |

**a) Diversification**
Out of the four strategies, this is the **riskiest** growth strategy. This strategy involves launching a new product in a new market‚Äîwhich means there would be no existing customer base, no proven demand, and no product history to rely on.

**b) Market Development**
This strategy involves introducing your current products to **new markets**. That could mean expanding geographically, targeting a new demographic, or finding a new use case for the product.

**c) Market Penetration** ‚úÖ
This is the right answer.

**d) Product Development**
This strategy involves creating **new products** for the **current market**. This could be a product upgrade, a new feature, or even an entirely new product that complements an existing product line.
