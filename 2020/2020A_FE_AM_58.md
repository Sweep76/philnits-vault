## **Explanation:**

A **system auditor** is a professional responsible for evaluating an organization's information systems, including its software, hardware, data, and processes. The goal of a system auditor is to ensure that systems are functioning effectively, securely, and in compliance with relevant regulations and policies.
### Other Operations

 **a)** Having only one auditor is not always necessary. Multiple auditors can help gather more information and provide different views.

**b)** Auditors can identify problems, but it's not their job to order the department to fix them. They recommend changes, but management decides what to do.

**d)** Interviewing only auditors can create bias. Itâ€™s better to talk to people in various roles to get a complete picture of the department.
