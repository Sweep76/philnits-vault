Which of the following tests verifies the interfaces between two (2) modules or subsystems?

a) Acceptance test
b) Integration test
c) Operational test
d) Unit test
?
b) Integration test
### Explanation

Integration testing is specifically designed to verify the interfaces and interactions between two or more modules or subsystems. This type of testing focuses on how different components work together and helps identify issues that may arise when combining them.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) Acceptance test.**

- Acceptance testing is performed to determine whether the system meets the specified requirements and is ready for delivery. It focuses on validating the overall functionality rather than the interfaces between individual modules.

**c) Operational test.**

- Operational testing typically involves assessing the system's performance in a real-world environment and may focus on operational aspects rather than the interactions between modules or subsystems.

**d) Unit test.**

- Unit testing is concerned with verifying the functionality of individual components or modules in isolation. It does not address the interactions or interfaces between multiple modules.
