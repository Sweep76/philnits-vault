Which of the following is an appropriate explanation of a comprehensive patent cross license?

a) An agreement to share the necessary costs for patent registration is concluded.
b) The source code is published free of charge on the Internet or other places, and anyone may improve and redistribute the software.
c) The use of patent rights is mutually licensed among companies in the specified fields of technologies or products.
d) To ensure that a company’s patent rights are not violated, the right to stop a counterpart’s manufacturing is exercised.
?
c) The use of patent rights is mutually licensed among companies in the specified fields of technologies or products.
### Explanation

This option accurately describes a comprehensive patent cross license. In such agreements, two or more parties grant each other rights to use their respective patents, typically within specified areas of technology or products. This arrangement helps reduce the risk of litigation and fosters collaboration between companies.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) An agreement to share the necessary costs for patent registration is concluded.**

- This explanation does not capture the essence of a cross-license, which primarily focuses on mutual rights to use patents rather than cost-sharing for registration.

**b) The source code is published free of charge on the Internet or other places, and anyone may improve and redistribute the software.**

- This describes open-source licensing rather than a comprehensive patent cross license. Cross licensing is specifically related to patents, not software source code dissemination.

**d) To ensure that a company’s patent rights are not violated, the right to stop a counterpart’s manufacturing is exercised.**

- This statement refers to enforcing patent rights rather than the concept of a cross license, which is about granting mutual rights to use patents rather than restricting or stopping production.
