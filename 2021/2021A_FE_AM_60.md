?
d) An output list resulting from data entry is cross-checked with the input form.
### Explanation

**d) An output list resulting from data entry is cross-checked with the input form.**

- This is an example of a **detective control**, as it involves identifying errors or irregularities after they have occurred by comparing the output with the input to verify accuracy. Detective controls are designed to find and report errors, fraud, or other issues that might occur during a process.
### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) A data entry manual is created, and the persons in charge of data entry are trained.**

- This is a **preventive control** because it aims to prevent errors by ensuring that employees are trained and informed before performing data entry tasks.

**b) A data entry screen is designed so that operation errors are unlikely to occur.**

- This is also a **preventive control**, as it is intended to reduce the likelihood of errors occurring during data entry by designing a user-friendly interface.

**c) Access rights are assigned only to the person in charge of data entry.**

- This is another **preventive control** aimed at preventing unauthorized access or misuse by limiting access rights to only those who need them.
