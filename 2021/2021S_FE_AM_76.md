There are several quality control tools that have been used primarily for manufacturing inspection departments. Which of the following is a combined graph containing a bar graph that shows the numeric values of individual items in descending order, and a line graph that shows the cumulative total of the composition ratios of these numeric values?

a) Control chart
b) Histogram
c) Pareto chart
d) Scatter diagram
?
c) Pareto chart

## Explanation

### Option a)
- used to monitor the stability of a process over time and to identify variations that may indicate a problem
- consists of a line graph with control limits

### Option b)
- a type of bar chart
- represents the distribution of numerical data by showing the frequency of data points within certain ranges

### Option c) (ANSWER)
- combines a bar graph and a line graph
- bars represent the individual values in descending order, showing the frequency or cost of problems
- line graph shows the cumulative total percentage of these values

### Option d)
- used to identify the relationship between two variables
- consists of points plotted on a graph to see if there is any correlation
