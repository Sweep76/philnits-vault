What is the Hamming distance of bit strings 10101 and 11110?

**a) 0**

**b) 2**

**c) 3**

**d) 5**
?
**c) 3**
## **Explanation:**
**Hamming distance** is a metric used in information theory and coding theory to measure the difference between two strings of equal length. It is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols (bits) in the two strings are different.

The Hamming distance between two strings $s_{1}$ and $s_2$ of equal length $n$ is calculated as:

$d(s_{1},s_{2}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(s_{1}[i] \neq s_{2}[i])$
where $s_{1}[i]$ and $s_{2}[i]$ are the characters at the $i$-th position of the strings.

To calculate the hamming distance of bit strings 10101 and 11110:
- 1 vs 1 => same
- 0 vs 1 => different
- 1 vs 1 => same
- 0 vs 1 => different
- 1 vs 0 => different
There are 3 different characters between the two bit strings so the hamming distance is **3**. Therefore, the answer is **c**.
