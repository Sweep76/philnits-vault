Which of the following is the standard API (Application Programming Interface) used by a Java application to access a database?


**a) HTML**

**b) Java VM**

**c) JDBC**

**d) SQL**
?
**c) JDBC**

## **Explanation:**

**Java Database Connectivity (JDBC**) is the standard API in Java for connecting and executing queries with a database. It provides methods to query and update data in a database. Therefore, the answer is **c)**.

**a) HTML**: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is used for creating and structuring content on the web. It does not provide an interface for database access.

**b) Java VM**: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an environment that allows Java bytecode to be executed. It is not an API for database access.

**d) SQL**: Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language used for managing and manipulating databases. While SQL is often used within JDBC to perform database operations, it is not an API itself.
