Which of the following is an appropriate description of a UML use case diagram?

**a) It shows the behavior during the object’s life cycle using finite state transitions.**

**b) It shows the exchange of messages among objects and objects’ lifelines in a time series.**

**c) It shows the flow from one activity to another activity in a system or business process.**

**d) It shows the scenarios for how actors, i.e., external users or machines, interact with a system.**
?
**d) It shows the scenarios for how actors, i.e., external users or machines, interact with a system.**

## **Explanation:**

A UML (Unified Modeling Language) use case diagram is used to represent the functional requirements of a system. It illustrates:

- **Actors:** External entities (users or other systems) that interact with the system.
- **Use Cases:** Specific functions or scenarios that the system performs in response to the actions of the actors.

The use case diagram helps in visualizing the relationships between actors and use cases, highlighting what the system does from the user’s perspective.

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** This describes a state machine diagram, which models the states and transitions of an object over its life cycle.
- **b)** This describes a sequence diagram, which illustrates the interactions and message exchanges among objects over time.
- **c)** This describes an activity diagram, which represents workflows and the flow of control in a system or process.

In summary, the correct answer is **d) It shows the scenarios for how actors, i.e., external users or machines, interact with a system.**
