In UML 2.0, which of the following is a diagram that represents the interactions between objects in time series?

**a) Activity diagram**

**b) Component diagram**

**c) Sequence diagram**

**d) State transition diagram**
?
**c) Sequence diagram**

## **Explanation:**

A **sequence diagram** is a type of interaction diagram that shows how objects interact in a particular scenario of a use case. It focuses on the order of messages exchanged between objects over time, displaying the sequence of events that occur. The vertical axis represents the different objects (lifelines), while the horizontal axis shows the messages exchanged in a time-ordered fashion.

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **a) Activity diagram:** This diagram represents workflows and the flow of control or activities in a system but does not focus specifically on time-ordered interactions.
- **b) Component diagram:** This diagram shows the organization and dependencies among components in a system, emphasizing the architecture rather than interactions.
- **d) State transition diagram:** This diagram describes the states of an object and the transitions between those states, focusing on the lifecycle of an object rather than time-based interactions.

In summary, the correct answer is **c) Sequence diagram.**
