Which of the following is a structural design pattern that allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together?

**a) Adapter**

**b) Factory**

**c) Iterator**

**d) Singleton**
?
**a) Adapter**

## **Explanation:**

The **Adapter pattern** acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. It allows a class to work with methods or functions that are incompatible by converting the interface of one class into an interface that the client expects. This pattern enables integration of different systems and promotes code reusability.

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **b) Factory:** The Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.
- **c) Iterator:** The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the underlying representation of the collection.
- **d) Singleton:** The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that restricts a class to a single instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

In summary, the correct answer is **a) Adapter.**
