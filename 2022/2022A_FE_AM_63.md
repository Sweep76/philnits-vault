Which of the following is a usage scenario for the adoption of UML as a technique for visualizing business processes?

**a) Diagrams are shown by using a data-oriented approach where objects are handled as entities, their attributes, and the relationships among the entities.**

**b) To represent processes by using data flows, sources and sinks of data, data stores, and data processes are connected with arrows that indicate data flow.**

**c) To represent processes from multiple viewpoints, some purpose-specific modeling methods are used, and each model is depicted by using standardized notation rules for object modeling.**

**d) To thoroughly represent the functions of a process, the events that occur in response to a single request are described by using the conditional branch format.**
?
**c) To represent processes from multiple viewpoints, some purpose-specific modeling methods are used, and each model is depicted by using standardized notation rules for object modeling.**

## **Explanation:**

**UML** (Unified Modeling Language) is designed to provide a **standardized** way to visualize the design of a system. It can represent business processes from different **viewpoints** and utilize various **modeling methods** while adhering to standardized notation, making it effective for visualizing complex business scenarios.

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** This describes a **data-oriented approach**, which is not specifically aligned with UML's primary function of visualizing system designs.
- **b)** This scenario relates to **data flow diagrams**, which focus on data movement rather than the object-oriented approach of UML.
- **d)** While conditional branching is important in process representation, UML encompasses broader aspects of system design rather than focusing solely on events responding to requests.

In summary, the correct answer is **c) To represent processes from multiple viewpoints, some purpose-specific modeling methods are used, and each model is depicted by using standardized notation rules for object modeling.**
