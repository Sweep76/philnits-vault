a) (A AND 31) OR 64

### Let's assume A is a non-negative integer, in this case we can use 99.

$(99 \bmod 32) + 64$ = $3 + 64$ = $67$

### Then, we test out each choices is it corresponds to the output.

**Bitwise Representation: A AND 31**
- $A = 1100011$, $31 = 0011111$
- We then perform the AND operation

	1100011
	0011111
	---------
	0000011

**0000011** is 3, which is correct as 99 % 32 == 3

**+ 64**
- In binary terms, *+* == *OR*, so we're gonna be using the *OR* operator here.
- Since we already got the result of the modulo operation, which is **0000011**, all that's left is to add 64.
- $64 = 1000000$

	0000011
	1000000
	---------
	1000011

**1000011** is 67, which matches the output 67 in *DECIMAL*.

### Hence, the correct answer is a) as we used **(A AND 31) OR 64**
