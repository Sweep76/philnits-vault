Among UML 2.x (including 2.0 and later versions) diagrams, which of the following is the most appropriate diagram that gives a graphic overview of the actors involved in a system, the different functions those actors need to perform, and how these different functions interact?
a) Activity diagram
b) Communication diagram
c) Interaction overview diagram
d) Use case diagram
?
d) Use case diagram
## **Explanation:**

UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a general-purpose modeling language which aims to define a standard way to visualize the way a system has been designed. It is quite similar to blueprints used in other fields of engineering. UML diagrams are used to visually represent different parts of a system, and each diagram type serves a unique purpose in system modeling.

- A): Activity diagram: Used to model workflows and processes, showing the flow of activities and decisions. We basically depict workflows visually using an activity diagram.
- B): Communication diagram: Used to show interactions between objects, emphasizing the exchange of messages. It's useful for understanding how objects collaborate but is not ideal for showing actors and system functions in a broad sense.
- C): Interaction overview diagram: Used to illustrate the flow of interactions between various elements in a system or process. It provides a high-level overview of how interactions occur, showing the sequence and flow of interactions. However, it is more complex and not focused on high-level actor-function relationships.
- **D): Use case diagram: Used to depict the functionality of a system or a part of a system. This diagram gives a clear graphic overview of the actors (users or external systems), their functions (the tasks they need to perform), and how these functions interact with the system. It is specifically designed for this purpose and is often used during the early stages of system design.**
