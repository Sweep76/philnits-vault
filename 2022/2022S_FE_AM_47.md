Which of the following is an appropriate explanation of encapsulation in object
orientation?
a) Abstraction and grouping of several objects that have common properties
b) Bundling of data and the procedures operating on the data as a single object and
concealment of their implementation inside the object
c) Creation of a base class by extracting the properties that are common among classes
d) Inheritance of the properties of a base class by a subclass
?
b) Bundling of data and the procedures operating on the data as a single object and
concealment of their implementation inside the object
## **Explanation:**

Encapsulation is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). It refers to bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit, usually an object. Encapsulation also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which means that the internal workings (implementation details) of an object are hidden from the outside world, and only necessary aspects (like methods to manipulate data) are exposed.

- A) Abstraction and grouping of several objects that have common properties:  This option describes abstraction or class grouping, which refers to grouping objects based on common attributes or properties. This is more about classification than data hiding or bundling.
- **B) Bundling of data and the procedures operating on the data as a single object and concealment of their implementation inside the object:  Correct. It highlights both the bundling of data with methods and the concealment of internal implementation, which is central to encapsulation in OOP.**
- C) Creation of a base class by extracting the properties that are common among classes:  This describes generalization or abstraction, which is the process of creating a base class by factoring out common properties of derived classes.
- D) Inheritance of the properties of a base class by a subclass: This option explains inheritance, another OOP concept where a subclass inherits the attributes and methods of a parent class. While related to OOP, it is not an explanation of encapsulation.
