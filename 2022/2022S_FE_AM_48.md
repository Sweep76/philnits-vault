Which of the following is a technique that embeds logical expressions that hold true for
the relations or conditions between variables at specific points in the execution of a program
and verifies the validity of the program?
a) Assertion check
b) Code trace
c) Snapshot dump
d) Test coverage analysis
?
a) Assertion check
## **Explanation:**

A technique / method used during program execution that ensures specific conditions or relations between variables are true. This method helps verify the correctness of the program by checking that certain logical expressions hold true at different points during execution.

- **A) Assertion check: Assertion checks are used to verify that a condition in the program is true at a particular point. If the condition is false, the program usually stops executing, which helps catch errors early. Assertions are often used to ensure that variables meet certain criteria during execution, making them a key tool for verifying program correctness. For example, we may use assertion to check if the pointer returned by malloc() is NULL or not.**
- B) Code trace: Code tracing involves manually or automatically stepping through the program to track its execution and understand how it operates. While useful for debugging, it does not actively embed logical expressions that validate program correctness during execution.
- C) Snapshot dump: A snapshot dump captures the state of a program at a specific point in time, typically for debugging purposes. This includes details about the current memory usage, variables, object references, and the call stack of threads. In Java, this is often achieved through heap dumps or thread dumps. While this can be helpful in analyzing a program's behavior, it doesn't verify logical conditions in real-time.
- D) Test coverage analysis: Test coverage analysis measures how much of the programâ€™s code is exercised by a set of tests, which is useful for ensuring code quality. It helps determine whether the tests adequately cover the codebase and which parts of the code are tested or not tested. However, it doesn't directly embed logical expressions to check conditions during execution.
