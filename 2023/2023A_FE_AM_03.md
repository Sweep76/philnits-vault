# 2023A_FE_AM_3 %% ex. 2024S_FE-A_83 %%

A parking lot has 10 parking spaces in a row, and 7 cars are parked at random parking spaces. What is the probability that the three empty places are adjacent to each other?

a) $\frac{1}{90}$
b) $\frac{1}{72}$
c) $\frac{1}{15}$
d) $\frac{1}{12}$
?
c) $\frac{1}{15}$
### Step 1: We Calculate the Total Number of Ways to Arrange 3 Empty Parking Spaces


We do $10\choose_{3}$ or $10C3$ if you're using a calculator. This calculates to 120 total ways to arrange the empty parking spaces.

To calculate this manually the choose function `C(n,k)` is equal to $\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$

### Step 2: Count the Favorable Combinations

We can illustrate the parking spaces and count how many ways we can arrange the 3 empty parking spaces to be adjacent to each other like so:

So we have 8 favorable combinations to arrange the empty parking spaces, assuming the other parking spaces have cars on them.

### Step 3: Calculate the Probability of Favorable Combinations

The formula to calculate the probability of favorable combinations is $\frac{favorable}{total}$ which is $\frac{8}{120}$ in our case.

Then we simplify it to $\frac{4}{60} \equiv \frac{2}{30} \equiv \frac{1}{15}$ which corresponds to answer c.
