## HTML

> [!info] HyperText Markup Language

It is a standardized markup language which is used to define elements & attributes for websites to have a specification to display web content across browsers.

### Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>HTML Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph in HTML.</p>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image">
</body>
</html>
```

- standardized format that any web browser & application with an HTML parser can read

## XML

> [!info] eXtensible Markup Language

It is similar to HTML, but you can define your own tags & attributes. The issue is - the application does not know how to properly parse your XML unless you program it to parse your tags.

Some examples of tech that integrate or use XML include;
- SVG
- XHTML (from C Sharp - it's HTML with more tags),
- `beans.xml` the config file for Java applications.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<document>
    <title>XML Example</title>
    <content>
        <heading>Welcome to XML</heading>
        <paragraph>This is a paragraph in XML.</paragraph>
        <image src="image.jpg" description="Image"/>
    </content>
</document>
```

- not standard tags, it's user-defined
- the application won't know how to parse it unless we give it instructions to do so
- it has many variations and permutations for different types of applications

```xml
<book>
    <title>XML Fundamentals</title>
    <author>John Doe</author>
    <price>29.99</price>
</book>
```
- it's also used for the SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) architecture of data transfer, back when REST APIs were not that popular
	- we shifted to JSON instead of XML because JSON is cheaper to send - less characters (tags)

## Going Back to Our Choices


a) It is based on HTML and expands its functions.
- no, it doesn't necessarily have to expand HTML, it can be like a config file like `beans.xml` for Java.

b) It requires a dedicated editor for writing XML documents.
- no, you can edit it with any text editor. It's just a plaintext file after all.

c) It integrates the logical structure and display style of documents.
- no, XML only cares about the logical structure of its tags, not the display style of documents.
- only HTML can inline CSS to talk about display style of documents.

d) It enables users to define the attribute information and logical structure of documents by using the user’s own tags.
- yes, we, as the user, can define attribute & logical structure (tags)
- this is the correct choice
