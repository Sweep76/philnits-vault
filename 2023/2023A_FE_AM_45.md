arrows.
d) It represents the flow of data between an external interface, processes, and data store.
?
a) It represents a combination of conditions and the corresponding operations.


## Analyze the Question & Answers

We are looking for the definition of a "decision table".

### a) It represents a combination of conditions and the corresponding operations.

This sounds right, combination can be like a matrix (multidimensional data structure) of conditions & operations.

### b) It represents entities by rectangles and their relationship through connecting lines.

This sounds like an Entity Relationship Diagram used for defining the database schema & each table's (entity) relationships with one another.

### c) It represents the flow of controls, such as a process or selection, by straight lines or arrows.

This is for Flowcharts or Data Flow Diagrams.

### d) It represents the flow of data between an external interface, processes, and data store.

This is also for Data Flow Diagrams.
