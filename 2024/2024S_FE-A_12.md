There is a system where the operating status is continuously monitored. Which of the following is an appropriate sequence of work items in capacity planning that is conducted when a new task is applied to the system after several years of operation?

[Work items in capacity planning] 
(i) Evaluate the proposed system configuration, assess its appropriateness, and conduct a review if necessary. 
(ii) Consider a proposal for the necessary system configuration based on the system characteristics, including factors such as the number of servers and whether parallel distributed processing is performed. 
(iii) Understand the performance information of the hardware or the environment inherent to the system based on the operating status of the system. 
(iv) Conduct a meeting with users to gather information about the new task, understand requirements such as the estimated number of processes, and determine the time required for processes.

a) (iii), (ii), (iv), (i)
b) (iii), (iv), (ii), (i)
c) (iv), (ii), (i), (iii)
d) (iv), (iii), (i), (ii)
?
b) (iii), (iv), (ii), (i)
### Explanation


This is a logic based question, as it calls for an appropriate sequence for capacity planning.

Based on the diagram above for the steps in capacity planning, 

The categories of the choices can be divided into the following:
Learning the system → Learning the problem → Making/Construct the solution → Evaluate Performance.

This would then eliminate choices C and D because they both start with gathering information about the task instead of first checking the performance of the system.

The next choice that would be eliminated is A because step in A directly goes to making a solution without prior knowledge about the new task.
