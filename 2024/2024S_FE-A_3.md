The expression below is represented in postfix (reverse Polish) notation. What is the resulting value of this expression? Here, the numbers are in decimal, and the symbols ‘+’, ‘−’, ‘*’, and ‘/’ represent addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators, respectively

100 5 6 2 + * 12 4 / − − 36 −

a) 5
b) 18
c) 21
d) 27
?
d) 27
### Step 1: Understanding Postfix Notation


In postfix notation, the operator appears after the operands, i.e., the operator between operands is taken out & is attached after operands.

**Example:**  Translate a ∗ d − (b + c) into Postfix form.****

ad ∗ bc + −

since operators appear after operands ad * becomes translated into a * d and bc + becomes translated into b + c. Since this forms the two operands (a * d) and (b + c), the remaining operator uses those two resulting operands as its arguments, becoming the equation:

a ∗ d − (b + c)

The most common way of visualizing this is using the *Stack Implementation*, which will be used in the next step
### Step 2: Using the Stack Implementation

**Given: 100 5 6 2 + * 12 4 / − − 36 −**

| **String Symbols**            | **Stack**         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 100 5 6 2 + * 12 4 / − − 36 − |                   |
| 100                           | 100               |
| 5                             | 100 5             |
| 6                             | 100 5 6           |
| 2                             | 100 5 6 2         |
| +                             | 100 5 (6 + 2)     |
| 5                             | 100 5 (8)         |
| *                             | 100 (5 * 8)       |
| 12                            | 100 (40) 12       |
| 4                             | 100 (40) 12 4     |
| /                             | 100 (40) (12 / 4) |
| -                             | 100 (40 - 3)      |
| -                             | (100 - 37)        |
| 36                            | 63 36             |
| -                             | (63- 36)          |
|                               | 27                |
Thus, the answer is 27
