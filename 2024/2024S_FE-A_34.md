### What is UML (Unified Modeling Language)?

Used to model non-software systems used for the military. Basically like a flowchart and the first version only has 9 diagrams.

### UML2

Updated version and is more powerful and has more diagrams, etc.

### State Diagrams

### State and Transition

- The state is the box. If a condition is satisfied, it runs inside.
- Transitions are the arrows that connects 2 messages together.

#### A transition may have a trigger, a guard and an effect.

- **Trigger** is the cause of the transition
- **Guard** is a condition for the trigger to cause its transition
- **Effect** is behavior that happens when the transition is triggered

### If nothing sticked, just remember that you're a solider in the military.

**State 1** - You're safe

**Trigger** - Enemy combatant threw a grenade at you
**Guard** - Holy crap gotta do something
**Effect** - Throw it back to him

**State 2** - Ez win

**You need a State and a Transition.**
