### Step 2: Flowchart Breakdown

From the flowchart notation legend above, we can see that the expression meant for A is a conditional expression.

Now to break down the process from the problem,
- **Initialization:
    - The variable `x` starts at 0 (to store the sum).
    - The variable `i` starts at 1 (the first odd integer).
- **Loop**:
    - The algorithm adds the current odd integer `i` to `x`.
    - Then, `i` is incremented by 2 to move to the next odd integer.
- **Termination Condition**:
    - The loop should stop when we have summed up the first N odd integers.
    - The N-th odd integer is 2N−1
    - Therefore, the loop needs to terminate when i exceeds 2N−1

Reasoning:
- The condition to exit the loop must check if i has exceeded 2N−1
- The **next odd number** after 2N−1 is 2N+1
- So, when iii reaches 2N+1, we know that the loop has summed all the necessary odd numbers and should stop.
