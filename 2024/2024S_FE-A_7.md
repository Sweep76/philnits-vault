Q7. How many swaps are required in bubble sort when N elements in the array are already sorted in reverse order?
a) $N(N-1) ÷ 2$
b) $N^2  ÷  2$
c) $N(N-1)$
d) $N^2$
?
a) $N(N-1) ÷ 2$
### Step 1: Understanding the Bubble Sort Algorithm


When the array is sorted in reverse order, every adjacent pair of elements is out of order. This means that every comparison will result in a swap.

- In the first pass through the array, bubble sort will compare the first element with the second, the second with the third, and so on, until the last element. This results in N−1 comparisons and swaps.
- In the second pass, the largest element (which is now at the end of the array) will not be compared. Thus, there will be N−2 comparisons and swaps.
- This pattern continues, leading to:
    - First pass: N−1N - 1N−1 swaps
    - Second pass: N−2N - 2N−2 swaps
    - Third pass: N−3N - 3N−3 swaps
    - ...
    - Last pass: 1 swap

Given this, you can the total number of swaps through this formula:

$Total Swaps=(N−1)+(N−2)+(N−3)+…+1$

or through

$N(N-1) ÷ 2$
